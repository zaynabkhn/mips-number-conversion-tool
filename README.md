# MIPS Number Conversion Tool

This is a simple MIPS Assembly program that converts a user-input decimal number into its binary and hexadecimal representations and prints the results.

## Features
- Input: Reads an integer number from the user.
- Output: Displays the number in binary and hexadecimal formats.
- Demonstrates: loops, division/modulo operations, ASCII output, and user I/O in MIPS.

## How to run
1. Open `number_converter.asm` in the MARS MIPS simulator.
2. Assemble and run.
3. Follow on-screen prompts to enter a decimal number.
4. View the converted binary and hexadecimal outputs.

## Tools
- MARS MIPS Simulator
- MIPS Assembly Language
